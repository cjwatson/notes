  ``SIGBREAK`` signal)

Note: On my Lenovo T430 laptop, I have to use the "Fn" key:

* Fn + B: Break

* Fn + S: SysRq

Alternative terminals for Windows:

* `ConEmu <https://conemu.github.io/>`_
* `mintty <https://mintty.github.io>`_


cmd.exe (Windows "shell", Windows console, the MS-DOS black window)
===================================================================

* Change prompt: ``set PROMPT=$P$G``

* Redirect stdout and stderr into the file ``outlog.log``:
  ``command >output.log 2>&1``

======================  ====================  ==========================================================
Windows command         UNIX command          Comment
======================  ====================  ==========================================================
``set``                 ``env``               Display all environment variables
``type file.exe``       ``cat file.txt``      Display the content of ``file.txt``

``dir NAME /s /p``      ``find -name NAME``   Find a file by its name in subdirectories
``shutdown /p /f``      ``sudo poweroff``     Turn off the computer
======================  ====================  ==========================================================

To emulate top on Windows, run powershell.exe and type::

    while (1) { ps | sort -desc cpu | select -first 15; sleep -seconds 2; cls }

Press CTRL+c to stop it.


Configure vim on Windows
========================

* Right click on gvim: Run as administrator
* Open /program files (x86)/vim/_vimrc
* Comment the lines ``source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim`` and ``behave mswin``
* Add custom config


Mount Windows directory on Linux
================================

Command to mount the Widows "test" directory locally to ``~/mnt``, local
files will be owned by the user ``haypo:haypo``::

    sudo mount.cifs '//192.168.0.14/test' ~/mnt -o 'user=USERNAME,pass=PASSWORD,uid=haypo,gid=haypo'

=============  ======  ========

Configure a shell to use the VS C compiler in 64-bit mode::

    "%VS140COMNTOOLS%\..\..\VC"\vcvarsall.bat amd64

Argument:

* ``x86``: compile in 32-bit mode
* ``amd64``: compile in 64-bit mode
* ``x86_amd64``: cross-compile to 64-bit mode on a 32-bit system


Configuration
=============

Git configuration file
----------------------

Filename: ``C:\Users\haypo\.gitconfig``. Run cmd.exe as administrator to be
allowed to create symbolic links.

Windows console, cmd.exe
------------------------

Right click on the title, Properties: set Buffer Size of Command History to
999 (default: 50).

Windows variants
================

To develop on CPython: get a "multi-version" of Windows 10 (no N, KN or VL
variant) and use a "Pro - Retail" product key. Create of a VM with 40 GB of
disk.

Flavors:

* Family: basic feature set
* Pro: more features
* Entreprise: even more features

Variants:

* "N": Not with Media Player; for Europe.
* "KN": specially designed for Korean market and does not include Windows Media
  Player (WMP) and an instant messenger.
* "VL": Volume License,  a single license key can be used to activate multiple
  installations of Windows 10. This is usually used by large enterprises.
* "S": "Windows 10 S can only run apps from the Windows Store". Windows 10 S is
  designed to run well even on lower-end laptops. Windows 10 S is focused on
  speed, better battery life, and higher performance.


Some Windows error codes
========================

* 5: ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED: Access is denied.
* 996: ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE: Overlapped I/O event is not in a signaled state.
* 10060: WSAETIMEDOUT

See the full list of `Windows System Error Codes
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/debug/system-error-codes>`_.


Windows exceptions
==================

* EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION = STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION = ``c0000005`` (hex) = ``3221225477`` or ``-1073741819``
* CONTROL_C_EXIT = STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT = ``C000013A`` (hex) = ``3221225786``

OpenSSH server
==============

To use the OpenSSH server from Microsoft (the "Optional feature"), you need
at least Windows 10 build 1803. Before, this flavor was unusable.

* Go to settings, search for "Manage Optional Features": enable OpenSSH
* In my case, I had to run ``\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh-keygen -A``
* The SSH private key is stored in ``%ProgramData%\ssh\ssh_host_ed25519_key``.
  This file must be owned by SYSTEM and the only permission must be that SYSTEM
  is allowed to Read this file.
* To allow incoming TCP connections to port 22 (SSH), run PowerShell as administrator and type::

    New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH SSH Server' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22

* Copy your SSH public key into ``C:\Users\vstinner\.ssh\authorized_keys`` (replace
  vstinner with your username!)
* Go to Windows Menu>search for "Services". In Services, search for "OpenSSH
  Server": click on Start.
* If OpenSSH server doesn't work, look into ``%ProgramData%\ssh\Logs\sshd.log``
* If the server works, you can change the Service start from Manual to
  Automatic.

To debug, you can install psexec, open a shell as SYSTEM with
``psexec -i -s -d cmd.exe`` and then type:
``C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\sshd.exe`` to run the SSH server in foreground.

Files and directories:

* ``C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\sshd.exe``: the SSH server program
* ``C:\ProgramData\ssh\ssh_host_ed25519_key``: SSH server private key
* ``C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config``: SSH server configuration file
* ``C:\ProgramData\ssh\Logs\sshd.log``: SSH server logs

Misc
====

* Get system load:: ``wmic cpu get loadpercentage``


Disable Windows Defender Realtime protection
============================================

On an idle Windows VM, the VM uses between more than 150% of the CPU. If I move
the mouse cursor, the CPU usage goes to 50%. It is the ``msmpeng.exe`` process
which uses the CPU. "ps" in PowerShell and the Task Manager don't agree
on the CPU usage: 50% according to ps, 2% according to the Task Manager...

If I disable Real Time protection in Windows Defender, the feature is enabled
again at next reboot...

I had to add a key into registry to ensure that Windows doesn't reenable
Real Time protection after reboot:

* run regedit.exe
* Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender
* Create a "DWORD (32-bit)" key called "DisableAntiSpyware", set its value
  to 1.
* Done.


Maximum path length
===================

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file
* MAX_PATH = 260 characters
* Does the **system** support long path? Query ``ntdll.RtlAreLongPathsEnabled()``

Application manifest to opt-in for "long path"::

    <application xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
      <windowsSettings>
        <longPathAware xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">true</longPathAware>
      </windowsSettings>
    </application>

An application only supports long if the system supports long path and the
application opts in for long path.

C languages: Windows types
==========================

`Windows Data Types
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types>`_:

* ``LPCTSTR``: ``CONST WCHAR *`` if ``UNICODE`` defined, ``CONST CHAR *``
  otherwise
