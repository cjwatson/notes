Documentation
=============

* `Faster CPython <http://faster-cpython.readthedocs.io/>`_
  (source code: `faster_cpython at github
  <https://github.com/vstinner/faster_cpython>`_)
* `Programming with Unicode <http://unicodebook.readthedocs.io/>`_
  (source code: `unicode_book at github
  <https://github.com/vstinner/unicode_book>`_)


Python Projects
===============

* `fatoptimizer <http://fatoptimizer.readthedocs.io/>`_: static optimizer for
  Python 3.6 using function specialization with guards. It is implemented as an
  AST optimizer. It is part of the `FAT Python
  <http://faster-cpython.readthedocs.io/fat_python.html>`_ project.
* `bytecode <http://bytecode.readthedocs.io/>`_: API to modify Python
  bytecode, and a peephole optimizer.
* `pyfailmalloc <https://github.com/vstinner/pyfailmalloc>`_: Debug tool for
  Python injecting memory allocation faults to simulate a low memory system to
  test how your application handles MemoryError exceptions.
* `sixer <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sixer>`_: add Python 3 support
  to Python 2 applications using the six module.
* `Hachoir <http://hachoir.readthedocs.io/>`_: Python library that allows
  to view and edit a binary stream field by field. In other words, Hachoir
  allows you to "browse" any binary stream just like you browse directories and
  files. A file is split in a tree of fields, where the smallest field is just
  one bit.

Other Projects
==============

* `"misc" repository <http://github.com/vstinner/misc>`_:

  - my "dot" files, configuration files: bashrc, hgrc, gitconfig, etc.
  - some command line program: apply_patch.py, scm.py
  - some Python scripts
  - some shell scripts: apt_get.sh, fedora_new_install.sh
